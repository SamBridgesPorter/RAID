**WARNING: SECURITY OF THIS EXTENSION IS STILL NOT A PRIORITY.** Do not store any funds in this wallet.

If you have successfully performed above steps, now you can post in threads which have "Aletheo" in topic and receive mainnet tokens as rewards.

The extension works in the background, you can just post as you post normally.
Basic rules for posting:

1.Only posts with unique text count.

2.Can't post with one address more often than roughly every minute.

3."Aletheo" in the topic of op-post is not case-sensitive.

4.Green text is ignored by the oracle, as well as reply links like >>. So a reply with an image will be considered an empty post and won't be registered.

5.Op posts are never registered, so never get paid. So Aletheo won't cause wipe.

6.You have to be human to post in Aletheo threads. Botting, especially blatant botting will get you nowhere.
