This version is only for browsers based on Firefox*

1.download latest .xpi file 0.1.4, easier to do this with Firefox.

2.install the extension(click on it when you have Firefox installed, if you didn't do this with Firefox in first step)

If you have successfully performed above steps, now you can post in threads which have "Aletheo General" in topic and receive mainnet tokens as rewards or you can create Aletheo General threads.

0.1.4 still requires to click additional button. Everytime you type on specific imageboards, a small "transact" button appears, you must click on it after *your post is ready* and you won't edit it anymore, so just before sending your post to the website. After you click on it, wait for "pending" to change to "success", then you can post.

**You can still install it in Chromium based browser, by changing file extension from .xpi to .zip, unpack it, enable developer mode in Chromium, and load the extension clicking on it's manifest.json, it works just fine*

**WARNING: EXTENSION SECURITY IS STILL NOT A PRIORITY.** Do not store any funds in this wallet.
