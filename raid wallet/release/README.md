This version is only for browsers based on Firefox*

1.download latest .xpi file 0.1.2, easier to do this with Firefox.

2.install the extension(click on it when you have Firefox installed, if you didn't do this with Firefox in first step)

3.generate new poster address in the extension(which is not supposed to hold any real funds, so if you don't know what you are doing, don't transfer anything to this address for your security). These poster addresses are disposable testnet addresses, don't deposit anything to these addresses.

4.go to https://faucet.matic.network/ and enter your poster address, get the tokens

5.go to https://infura.io/ and register a free rpc

6.click change plan for Infura, scroll down to network addons and choose Polygon PoS

7.on the next page choose free plan and enter valid bank card number, save it then click update subscription

8.then find "create new project" and create infura project with any name

9.find "endpoints" dropdown in project settings and choose Mumbai Polygon

10.copy Mumbai endpoint url

11.enter copied url in Aletheo extension Mumbai Testnet RPC URL and click save

Now you can post in threads which have "Aletheo General" in topic and receive mainnet tokens as rewards or you can create Aletheo General threads

**You can still install it in Chromium based browser, by changing file extension from .xpi to .zip, unpack it, enable developer mode in Chromium, and load the extension clicking on it's manifest.json, it works just fine*
