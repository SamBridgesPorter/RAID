This version is only for browsers based on Firefox.

1.download .xpi file, easier to do this with Firefox. 

2.install the extension(click on it when you have Firefox installed, if you didn't do this with Firefox in first step)

3.generate new poster address in the extension(which is not supposed to hold any real funds, so if you don't know what you are doing, don't transfer anything to this address for your security). These poster addresses are disposable testnet addresses, don't deposit anything to these addresses.

4.go to https://faucet.matic.network/ and enter your poster address, get the tokens

5.go to https://rpc.maticvigil.com and register a free rpc, enter it in the extension and save

6.enter your rewards address and save(the address from something secure at least like Metamask which will receive actual rewards)

7.post in threads which have "Aletheo General" in topic and receive mainnet tokens as rewards
