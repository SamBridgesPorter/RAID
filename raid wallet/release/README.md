This version is only for browsers based on Firefox*

1.download latest .xpi file 0.1.5, easier to do this with Firefox.

2.install the extension(click on it when you have Firefox installed, if you didn't do this with Firefox in first step)

If you have successfully performed above steps, now you can post in threads which have "Aletheo" in topic and receive mainnet tokens as rewards or, if there is no such thread, you can create Aletheo threads, except creation of a thread is not paid.

The extension works in the background, you can just post as you post normally.

**You can still install it in Chromium based browser, by changing file extension from .xpi to .zip, unpack it, enable developer mode in Chromium, and load the extension clicking on it's manifest.json, it works just fine*

**WARNING: SECURITY OF THIS EXTENSION IS STILL NOT A PRIORITY.** Do not store any funds in this wallet.
